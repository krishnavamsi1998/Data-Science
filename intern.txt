Sir,
I have completed an internship as a trainee in the field of machine learning organized by Smart Bridge in collaboration with IBM . It was a 1 month training course in Hyderabad.
I have competed a mini project in the last week of the internship along with my team members.
As I was the Team leader I made more contribution in completing the project and acquired some leadership skills and persuading skills.
Apart from that I am always interested in the field of Machine Learning and very curious to develop some advanced applications .
And I think through your platform I can able to do that and gain some experience .
Eagerly waiting for your reply.
Thank You.
